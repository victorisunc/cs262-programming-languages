# Writing Closure

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j

# Write the Python procedure, closure, that takes five parameters:

#   grammar: the grammar using the previously described structure
#   i: a number representing the chart state that we are currently looking at
#   x: a single nonterminal
#   ab and cd: lists of many things

# The closure function should return all the new parsing states that we want to
# add to chart position i


def closure(grammar, i, x, ab, cd):
    next_states = [(rule[0], [], rule[1], i) \
      for rule in grammar if cd != [] and rule[0] == cd[0]]
    return next_states

grammar = [
    ("exp", ["exp", "+", "exp"]),
    ("exp", ["exp", "-", "exp"]),
    ("exp", ["(", "exp", ")"]),
    ("exp", ["num"]),
    ("t", ["I", "like", "t"]),
    ("t", [""])
    ]

print closure(grammar, 0, "exp", ["exp", "+"], ["exp"]) == [('exp', [], ['exp', '+', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['exp', '-', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['(', 'exp', ')'], 0), ('exp', [], ['num'], 0)]
print closure(grammar, 0, "exp", [], ["exp", "+", "exp"]) == [('exp', [], ['exp', '+', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['exp', '-', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['(', 'exp', ')'], 0), ('exp', [], ['num'], 0)]
print closure(grammar, 0, "exp", ["exp"], ["+", "exp"]) == []
